This is the API for the BMA attendance system, being used in the [Arduino code](https://github.com/ParanoidBat/AttendanceSystem) and the [mobile application](https://github.com/ParanoidBat/BMA-Client-App).  
It is written in Nodejs and uses the PostgreSQL database.  

**Note:** If you have a question, you can open an issue and tag it with question or help wanted labels. But do make sure that you have actually read the code and have made some degree of understanding before opening a thread.
